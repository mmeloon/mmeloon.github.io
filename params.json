{"name":"Mark Meloon","tagline":"Mathematician and Data Scientist For Hire","body":"### Welcome to My Laboratory!\r\nNot only does data science require a great many skills, it also requires that its practitioners enjoy getting their hands dirty with real data and experimenting with what patterns they can find. This GitHub repository holds projects that I have developed either for personal use or that I use in working with select clients. If it's public, feel free to look at what I've done and use pieces of it if you wish.\r\n\r\n### Content\r\nData science covers a lot of ground and I have expertise in a number of areas. Most of the work here, however, will fall into the following categories:\r\n* Data cleansing\r\n* Machine learning\r\n* Social network analysis\r\n* Social media data\r\n* Big data\r\n\r\nThe code will usually be in Python, Java, Hive, and Pig. Data technologies will usually be Hadoop and MapReduce.\r\n\r\n### Available for Hire!\r\nI am currently seeking a full time position in data science with an aggressively-growing firm. Some things you should know about me:\r\n* Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from California Institute of Technology\r\n* 10+ years experience solving complex analytical problems using uncleansed data\r\n* Expertise in machine learning, statistical modelling, data fusion, and signal processing\r\n* 10+ years experience developing software in C/C++, Python, MatLab, and Java\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about me from [my LinkedIn profile](http://MeloonLinkedIn.com).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
