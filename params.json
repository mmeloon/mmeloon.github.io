{"name":"Mark Meloon","tagline":"Data Scientist Looking for New Opportunities","body":"# Welcome to My Repository!\r\n## About\r\nThis repository contains projects focused on data science, whether it is Hadoop project for analyzing Big Data or small R scripts or IPython notebooks for interactive exploration. Data science covers a lot of ground and I have expertise in a number of areas. Most of the work here, however, will fall into the following categories:\r\n* Data cleansing\r\n* Machine learning\r\n* Predictive analytics\r\n* Social media data\r\n* Big data\r\n\r\nPrograms will usually be in Python or Java. Big Data technologies will usually be for Hadoop v2.0+, although sometimes I'll create data models for RDBMS.\r\n\r\n## Available for Hire!\r\nI'm a senior data scientist at a Fortune 500 firm; however, I would much prefer to work for an agile, exciting company. A very basic summary of me:\r\n* Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from California Institute of Technology\r\n* 10+ years experience solving complex analytical problems using uncleansed data\r\n* Expertise in machine learning, statistical modelling, data fusion, and signal processing\r\n* 10+ years experience developing software in C/C++, Python, MatLab, and Java\r\n\r\n## More information\r\nThe best place to learn more about me is [my LinkedIn profile](http://MeloonLinkedIn.com). I have a very broad skill set and am uniquely qualified to be an extremely valuable addition to your company. Yes, I know all the mathematical modeling stuff, but I'm good at ALL aspects of the CRISP-DM model. Among some of my talents that most data scientists do not possess are by ability to:\r\n* Interact with client to uncover the **real** problem to be solved (oftentimes, not the one they originally think it is)\r\n* Know what level of model fidelity will solve the problem to acceptable accuracy and still remain within budget\r\n* Explain results in a manner that is clear, intriguing, compelling, and politically-savvy to non-specalists and/or skeptical audiences\r\n\r\nTo explore what I could bring to your team, please [email me](mailto:info@example.com?subject=Your%20GitHub%20Profile)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
